		  					My name is Ashif Nauz. I’m married and I have a beautiful 7 years old daughter. I’m a full-time employee at a dentist’s office in the center city. I’m majoring in Web Development and hoping to get an internship over the summer 2021 and expand my knowledge and experience.

                       	<h1> Life Experience</h1>

                       	I was working like a workaholic person earning enough money to support my family but at the same time, that money was separating me from my family which is a very important part of life. That’s when I started to think about how can I make this better? How can I earn better money at the same time I am not worried about losing my family? And I realize that sometimes in life we need to go back in our time and fix or complete those tasks which were left incomplete. In my case, I left my study behind which I never completed.   Now I decided to pick up where I left off for a better future and opportunities. Now I am majoring as to become a Web Developers
